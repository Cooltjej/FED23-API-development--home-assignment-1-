Photo API with Postman

Hygiene Requirements

The following hygiene requirements must be met regardless of the grade level.

All source code must be written by yourself (although it's okay to use the Prisma boilerplate provided when accepting the assignment in GitHub Classroom).

Utilize Express and Prisma. Be written in TypeScript. Follow REST, CRUD, and Resource Controller patterns. All responses adhere to the JSend specification. Authentication via HTTP Basic/JWT with password hashing/salting using bcrypt. Validation of all incoming data. Adhere to specified endpoint specifications (including HTTP method, path, request, and response). Error handling (e.g., if the user attempts to access another user's albums or photos, or if the user tries to add a photo that does not belong to them to an album, or add a photo to a non-existent album). Utilize correct HTTP status codes. At least one migration. Ensure all source code is correctly indented (of course!). Published on [TBD].

Version Control

All development must be version controlled using GitHub Classroom. Regular commits with descriptive commit messages (in English).
